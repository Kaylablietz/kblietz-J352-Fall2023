<p id="text">Sitting at a metal cafeteria table with her brother and parents, a girl paints a beach scene onto a small canvas. She decides the sun should be pink, like the ribbons in her hair. The tables behind her are covered in toys and art supplies. Outside, yard games cover a small lawn. A boy in neon orange shorts tosses cornhole bags, stifling curses when he misses his mark. His father smiles. 

Families are everywhere, laughing with each other or feasting on large sub sandwiches and cookies. It’s a joyful day at the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility in Berlin, but the tall barbed wire fence surrounding the afternoon’s activities prevents any illusions. 

Ordinary moments of lunch and playtime are precious to the parents who are part of the Family Connections Center’s annual Family Fun Day. For a few hours, some of the parents serving time in New Hampshire’s state prisons can spend time with their children without supervision by a guardian or the abrupt end typical of regular, timed visits. They can hug or pick up their kids, actions sometimes prohibited during visits.

“The camp that we did last year, the Family Fun Day this year, are the first times that I’ve been able to be with [my son] alone without [his grandma] and to be able to be like that full parent,” said Samantha, an incarcerated mother enrolled in the Family Connections Center program at the New Hampshire Department of Corrections. “And that has just been so amazing. So I’m like, so grateful for those little chances that I get through this program.”

This year, the Family Fun Day event took place statewide at both state prisons for men, as well as the New Hampshire Correctional Facility for Women in Concord, where Samantha is a resident. It’s a culminating event for the Family Connections Center program at the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, which works to foster relationships between children and their incarcerated parents. 

To protect the privacy of their children and the victims involved, only first names of incarcerated individuals will be used in this story. </p>

<p id="text">Data suggests that programs like the FCC decrease recidivism rates, improve resident behavior, and help prevent the cycle of incarceration. A 2014 study published by authors from the University of Delaware and RTI International Research Institute found that women with stronger family connections are less likely to recidivate. For the children of incarcerated parents, there is a higher risk for developmental issues and their own incarceration. However, studies generally find maintaining a positive relationship with their incarcerated parent can help improve child behavior and create a sense of secure attachment.

The Department of Corrections tries to identify individuals who are parents during their initial processing, though eligibility for FCC depends on the crime committed. Negative behavior can also disqualify an individual from participating. Parents who choose to take part in the FCC program must complete an 18-hour parenting class and a 10-hour healthy relationships class. In addition, parents can attend ongoing support groups and participate in other FCC parenting programs, like video visits and family day events. 

“It really is just a place of belonging. When somebody comes into the program, they might be more of a fixed mindset,” said Tiffani Arsenault, administrator of the FCC. “Once they realize that the Family Connection Center is a safe place for them to talk about their kids and their challenges … then we see some of those walls come down and we see them listen more.”</p>

<p id="text">Amber, who is also incarcerated at the New Hampshire Correctional Facility for Women, said FCC has been key to navigating parenting challenges. 

“When I’m overwhelmed, [our counselor] is the person I go to when things are wrong,” she said. “Support group is the highlight of my week.”
